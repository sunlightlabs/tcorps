  Transparency Corps is the Sunlight Foundation's answer to the question, "How can I help?"
</p>

<p>
  There are many big problems that we can solve with technology, but we can't solve them all. For many of the projects that make government transparency a reality, human eyes and analysis are required. With Transparency Corps, we break those tasks down into short, small actions that make a BIG difference. Join the Corps, and let's get started!
